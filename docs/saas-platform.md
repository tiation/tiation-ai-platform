## 🛠️ Implementation & Integration

### Quick Start Guide

#### 1. Account Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Sign up for free trial
curl -X POST https://api.tiation.ai/v1/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "your@email.com",
    "company": "Your Company",
    "plan": "starter"
  }'
```

#### 2. API Key Generation
```bash
# Generate API key
curl -X POST https://api.tiation.ai/v1/auth/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "production-key"}'
```

#### 3. First API Call
```python
import requests

# Initialize the API client
api_key = "your-api-key-here"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}

# Make your first AI request
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.tiation.ai/v1/ai/analyze",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "text": "Analyze this customer feedback: Great product!",
        "model": "sentiment-analysis"
    }
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Sentiment: {result['sentiment']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}")
```

    annual_savings = monthly_savings * 12
    annual_cost = monthly_platform_cost * 12
    net_savings = annual_savings - annual_cost
    roi_percentage = (net_savings / implementation_cost) * 100
    payback_months = implementation_cost / (monthly_savings - monthly_platform_cost)
    
    return {
        "annual_savings": annual_savings,
        "annual_cost": annual_cost,
        "net_savings": net_savings,
        "roi_percentage": roi_percentage,
        "payback_months": payback_months
    }

# Example calculation
roi = calculate_roi(
    monthly_savings=15000,    # $15K saved per month
    implementation_cost=50000, # $50K implementation cost
    monthly_platform_cost=2499 # Enterprise plan cost
)
